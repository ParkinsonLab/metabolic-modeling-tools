The DEMETER paper is publised in Bioinformatics 2021 (https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/37/21/3974/6362871).

There are two main parts to run the DEMETER pipeline.


Part 1: Run KBase for draft reconstruction (https://narrative.kbase.us/narrative/ws.113268.obj.8)

1) Download genome from ncbi (in the *_genomic.fna.gz format)
2) Click plus button on the left top panel to import data
3) Import from staging area – parameter: assembly -> draft isolate
3) Unpack a Compressed File in Staging Area – do it one by one
4) Batch Import Assembly from Staging Area – parameter: draft isolate; output: assemblies
5) Annotate Multiple Microbial Assembilies – input: assemblies; parameters: list (*_genomic__ …), check all except the last one; output: genomes
6) Build Multiple Metabolic Models – input: *_genomic__.RAST; parameters: auto, gapfill  
7) Bulk Download Modeling Objects – input: *_genomic__.RAST.fbamodel
8) Extract results into your local folder, or for larger files go to step 9) and 10)
9) Export Data Object To Staging Area – output files into workspace_export\
10) link Globus with KBase to download files in workspace_export\


Part 2: Run DEMETER script in Matlab for gap filling

1) generate a taxonomic and strain info. file: 'mysp_infoFile.xlsx'
- The IDs in the column ‘MicrobeID’ need to match the names of the resulting refined reconstructions exactly.
- get taxanomic and strain info. from IMG (Integrated microbial genomes) https://img.jgi.doe.gov/
- get subsystem info. from pubseed

2) b5_demeter_run_single_reconstruction.m
For updating changes in the file ‘mysp_infoFile.xlsx’, you need to regenerate reaction files in InputData/. Therefore, you need to run initCobraToolbox first.
~\cobratoolbox\papers\2021_demeter\input\ReactionDatabase.txt contains all reactions and formulas
The “IReactionID” is from BiGG (http://bigg.ucsd.edu/universal/reactions/URIt4)
In “removeFutileCycles.m”, you have to modified the table “reactionsToReplace” by removing lines for “GLYO1”, “1H2NPTH”, “HSNOOX”, “34HPPORdc”, “SALCACD”, and “SQLE”.


The metabolic model is stroed in a MatLab data format (.mat). To convert it into .xml format, cobrapy is needed.

-- Running cobrapy on Scinet to convert the format of constructed models, i.e. from .mat to .xml

  module load NiaEnv/2019b python/3.8
  source ~/.virtualenvs/myenv/bin/activate
  python
  > import cobra
  > import libsbml
  > model = cobra.io.load_matlab_model("Escherichia_coli_K12_MG1655.mat")
  > cobra.io.write_sbml_model(model, " Escherichia_coli_K12_MG1655.xml")
